    - Jensen Huang
    - Chris Malachowsky
    - Curtis R. Priem

* Company Funding:

    Nvidia receives most of the funding through equity. The largest stakeholders are asset managers BlackRock and Vanguard who hold mutual funds and ETFs on behalf of their clients.

* Decision to choose this company:

    Nvidia is one of the leading suppliers of AI hardware and software in various fields. In the field of Health Care and Life Sciences, Nvidia is one of the leading players and has made significant progress in the last 10 years. One of their product BioNeMo is very attractive to the medical AI world and has provided significant benefits to the world of drug discovery.


## Business Activities

* Problem the company or project trying to solve:

    - Drug discovery is a lengthy and costly process that takes around 10-15 years for discovery and around $1-2 billion dollar before it is approved for clinical use. Nearly 9 out of 10 candidates fail during subsequent phases of the trial including phase 1, 2 and 3 trials. These costs are also accompanied by a 90% failure rate which is a huge monetary risk to companies.

    - The goal is to lower the rate of unsuccessful trials and ultimately improve the drug development journey.

    - This is achieved by creating platforms and APIs for customers to create, train and deploy complex models. This is done through Nvidia's BioNeMo-Powered AI.

* Company's intended customer and market size:

    - Nvidia's intended customers in this field are drug research companies all over the world.

    - As of today there are more than 100 companies that have integrated BioNeMo-Powered AI. A few customers are Astellas Pharma, Deloitte, Amgen, Siemens Healthineers etc.

* Reason to choose this company over their competitors:

    - Huge Cloud Infrastructure
    - Cheap Drug Discovery Process
    - Easy integration with the APIs, configure multi-GPU, multinode training with data parallelism, model parallelism and mixed precision.
    - Fast API response
    - Multimodal and Multi-Domain datasets
    - Self-Trained Chemistry Language Models (CLMs) and Protein Language Models (PLMs)
    - Wet-Lab experiments data

* Technologies used:

    - NVIDIA DGX Cloud on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI)
    - Generative AI
    - Large Language Model(LLM) and other custom models


* Implementation:

    - NVIDIA BioNeMo is used for training and deploying large biomolecular language models at a supercomputing scale for the discovery and development of therapeutics.

    - Protein structure prediction aims to anticipate how a protein will fold into its natural shape, which is crucial for understanding its function in the human body and identifying potential targets for drug therapies.

    - One of the customers of Nvidia, Deloitte has developed an AI drug discovery accelerator that analyzes amino acid sequences to determine the best folding method. This process quickly generates 3D structures and predicts how drugs may bind to specific parts of the protein. A downstream generative AI model further refines the structure of protein and pinpoint the regions that are likely to interact with drugs helping the drug development efforts. To achieve this Deloitte has used Nvidia BioNeMo microservices to bring the data and scientific pipelines together to optimize structure prediction.

    - With this seamless mapping of molecules into the solution space, similar molecules with corresponding properties such as toxicity and solubility can easily be found. This meticulous process is crucial in drug discovery, facilitating the efficient selection of potential candidates, accurate prediction of safety and efficacy and exploration of diverse chemical spaces.


## Landscape

* Fields the company is in:

    - Gaming: GPUs for gaming and cryptocurrency mining
    - Professional visualization: GPUs for designers and scientists
    - Data Center: Data center processors for analytics and AI including HealthCare
    - Automotive: SoCs for mobile computing and automotive markets such as robotics and self-driving cars

* Major trends and innovations in this field over the last 5&ndash;10 years:

    - Accurate analysis of large amounts of data and efficient process enabled faster drug discovery identification and development of new medications.
    - The Internet of Things powered by AI and machine learning capabilities has made it easier for patients to be proactive participants in their health care.
    - AI is used by epidemiologists to analyze data and flag early warning signs of possible infectious disease outbreaks.
    - AI's predictive algorithms have enhanced clinical trials by identifying ideal trial sites and principal investigators for recruiting target patient groups.
    - Robotic surgical equipment outfitted with AI has helped doctors decrease physical fluctuations and provide updated information during operations.

* What are the other major companies in this field?
    - Quantinuum
    - Owkin
    - Evonetix
    - BenchSci
    - Benevolent.ai

## Results

* Business impact of this company so far:

    - More than 100 companies have integrated with BioNeMo-Powered AI into drug discovery workflows.
    - Improved developer productivity integrating with Nvidia interface by 50% percent.
    - Reduced training of models from four weeks to eight hours.
    - Reduced drug discovery pipeline development time from 4-6 weeks to just a few clicks.

* Core metrics:

    - API Integration time
    - Developer productivity
    - Drug discovery pipeline development time
    - Model training time

* Performance of the company compared to its competitors:

    - Backed with huge infrastructure and AI chips, Nvidia has increased its customer base quickly.
    - Comparatively new to health care, competitors backed by specific health care have an advantage over Nvidia and Nvidia is trying to fill in the gap soon.

## Recommendations

* Additional products or services the company should offer:

    - Nvidia needs to add new models for analyzing DNA sequences.
    - Nvidia needs to add new models for predicting protein structures and determining cell function based on mRNA data.
    - Nvidia can create Predictive AI to train the models. 

* Technologies this additional product or service utilizes:
    - Generative and Predictive AI
    - Train models with Predictive AI.

* Reason behind these technologies appropriate for my solution:
    - Predictive AI models don't eliminate laboratory experiments but can help researchers narrow the selection pool of potential drugs, allocating more time and resources to experiments on the more promising candidates.
    - Predictive machine learning models can help identify chemical and structural drug features likely to cause toxic effects in humans.
    - Predictive machine learning could provide a way to "fail faster" and focus their experimental efforts on the drugs with the best bio-availability.

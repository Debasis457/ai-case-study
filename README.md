## Overview and Origin

* Name of company:

    **Nvidia Corporation**

* Company incorporated on:

    **April 5, 1993**

* Overview:

    Nvidia corporation is an American multinational corporation and technology company headquartered in Santa Clara, California. Its is a software and fabless company which designs and supplies graphics processing units, application programming interfaces for data science and high-performance computing as well as system on a chip units for mobile computing and automotive market. It is also dominant supplier of artificial intelligence hardware and software.

* Founders of the company:

    - Jensen Huang
    - Chris Malachowsky
    - Curtis R. Priem

* Company Funding:

    Nvidia receives most of the funding through equity. The largest stakeholders are asset managers BlackRock and Vanguard who hold mutual funds and ETFs on behalf of their clients.

* Decision to choose this company:

    Nvidia is one of the leading supplier of AI hardware and software in various fields. In the field of Healthecare and Life Sciences, Nvidia is one of the leading players and have made significant progress in last 10 years. One of their product BioNeMo is very attractive to the medical AI world and has provided significant benefits to the world of drug discovery.


## Business Activities

* Problem the company or project trying to solve:

    - Drug discovery is a lengthy and costly process which takes around 10-15 years for discovery and around $1-2 billion dollar before it is approved for clinical use. Nearly 9 out of 10 candidates fail during subsequent phases of the trial including phase 1, 2 and 3 trials. These costs are also acompanied by 90% failure rate which is a huge monetary risk to companies.

    - Goal is to lower the rate of unsuccessful trials and ultimately improving the drug development journey.

    - This is achieved by creating platform and APIs for customers to create, train and deploy complex models. This is done through Nvidia's BioNeMo-Powered AI.

* Company's intended customer and market size:

    - Nvidia's intented customers in this field are drug research companies all over the world.

    - As of today there are more than 100 companies which have integrated BioNeMo-Powered AI. Few customers being Astellas Pharma, Deloitte, Amgen, Siemens Healthineers etc.

* Reason to choose this company over their competitors:

    - Huge Cloud Infrastructure
    - Cheap Drug Discovery Process
    - Easy integration with the APIs, configure multi-GPU, multinode training with data parallelism, model parallelism and mixed precision.
    - Fast API response
    - Multimodal and Multi-Domain datasets
    - Self-Trained Chemistry Language Models (CLMs) and Protein Language Models (PLMs)
    - Wet-Lab experiments data

* Technologies used:

    - NVIDIA DGX Cloud on Oracle Cloud Infrasctucture (OCI)
    - Generative AI
    - Large Language Model(LLM) and other custom models


* Implementation:

    - NVIDIA BioNeMo is used for training and deploying large biomolecular language model at supercomputing scale for the discovery and development of therapeutics.

    - Protein structure prediction aims to anticipate how a protein will fold into its natural shape, which is crucial for understanding its function in the human body and identifying potential targets for drug therapies.

    - One of the customers of Nvidia, Deloitte has developed an AI drug discovery accelerator that analyzes amino acid sequences to determine the best foling method. This process quickly generates 3D structures and predicts how drugs may bind to specific parts of the protein. A downstream generative AI model further refines the structure of protein and pinpoint the regions that are likely to interact with drugs helping the drug development efforts. In order to achieve this Deloitte has used Nvidia BioNeMo microservices to bring the data and scientific pipelines together to optimize structure prediction.

    - With this seamless mapping of molecules into the solution space, similar molecules with corresponding properties such as toxicity and solubility can easily be found. This meticulous process is crucial in drug discovery, facilitating the efficient selection of potential candidates, accurate prediction of safety and efficacy and exploration of diverse chemical spaces.


## Landscape

* Fields the company is in:

    - Gaming: GPUs for gaming and cryptocurrecny mining
    - Professional visualization: GPUs for designers and scientists
    - Data Center: Data center processors for analytics and AI including HealthCare
    - Automotive: SoCs for mobile computing and automotive markets such as robotics and self-driving cars

* Major trends and innovations of this field over the last 5&ndash;10 years:

    - Accurate analysis of large amounts of data and efficient process enabled faster drug discovery identification and development of new medications.
    - The Internet of Things powered by AI and machine learning capabilities has made it easier for patients to be proactive participants in their own health care.
    - AI is used by epidemiologists to analyze data and flag early warning signs of possible infectious disease outbreaks.
    - AI's predictive algorithms has enhanced clinical trials by identifying ideal trial sites and principal investigators for recruiting target patient groups.
    - Robotical surgical equipment outfitted with AI has helped doctors in decreasing physical fluctuations and providing updated information during operation.

* What are the other major companies in this field?
    - Quantinuum
    - Owkin
    - Evonetix
    - BenchSci
    - Benevolent.ai
